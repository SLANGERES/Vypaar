🔐 Authentication Flow
On login/signup, the backend issues a JWT token.

The token must be included in the Authorization cookies (Bearer <token>) for protected routes like product operations.

Middleware verifies the token and extracts user info from it.

🧪 API Overview
🔑 Auth Routes
POST /signup – Register a new user

POST /login – Authenticate user and receive JWT

📦 Product Routes (Protected)
GET /products – List all products

POST /products – Add a new product

PUT /products/:id – Update a product

DELETE /products/:id – Delete a product
