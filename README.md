## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User **signs up** with email and password.
2. Backend generates an **OTP**, stores in Redis, and pushes it to RabbitMQ.
3. Email service reads from queue and sends OTP via SMTP.
4. User **verifies** email using `/verify` endpoint.
5. On login, a **JWT token** is issued and required for protected routes.
6. If regenerate otp use `/generate-otp`
